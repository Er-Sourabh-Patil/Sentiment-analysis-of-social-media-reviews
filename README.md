# Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Reviews

This project is a machine learning-based web application that performs sentiment analysis on social media text reviews. It classifies user-generated text into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The system is designed to help businesses, researchers, and developers automatically gauge public sentiment from social media platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making and trend analysis.

The project consists of two main components:
1.A machine learning pipeline for training and evaluating sentiment classification models.
2.A Flask web application that provides a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment             prediction.

## Features
### Text Preprocessing Pipeline: Cleans and prepares raw social media text by removing noise (URLs, mentions, special characters), handling contractions, and performing tokenization.
### Multiple ML Model Support: Implements and compares different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
### Real-Time Prediction: Web interface for instant sentiment analysis of user-input text.
### Model Persistence: Trained models are saved and loaded for repeated use without retraining.
### Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed performance reports (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).
